	<p>The 2022-2023 school year has been pretty good. This year I took APCSP, AP Calculus BC, AP Biology, Honors English, AP Chinese, and APUSH. My favorite class was AP Biology. Also this year my team and I finished 2nd in a Berkeley Bioengineering Competition which was pretty cool. Calculus and APCSP were also cool classes because I like STEM in general.</p>
